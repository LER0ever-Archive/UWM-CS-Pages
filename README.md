# L.E.R Space
My personal website and blog.  

## About
I WAS a WordPress user, running my PHP version of L.E.R Space, until recenly. I found my wp site extremely slow to load and decided to write a static site generator. That's why Lumos was born and why this repo even exists.

Full Featured Static Site Generator

## About
### What it is
A static site generator, aiming to support most features of WordPress and replace my old WP Blog.
### Why? There're dozens of Hexo-s
I created this project mainly because I can't bear the slow loading speed of WordPress while there isn't a full alternative static site generator. It's probably just my personal project.
